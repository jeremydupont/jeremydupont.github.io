	<h1>Dogs Have Better Noses</h1>
	<p>Dogs can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 million 	times lower than humans can. The wet nose is essential for determining the 	direction of the air current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin 	are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air 	currents.</p>

	<h1>Cats Have Better Tongues</h1>
	<p>Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their  	coats. The cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers 	long, which are called papillae. These are quite rigid, as they contain 	keratin. These spines allow cats to groom themselves by licking their fur, 	with the rows of papillae acting like a hairbrush.</p>
